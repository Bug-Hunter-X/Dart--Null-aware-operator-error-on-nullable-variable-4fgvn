# Dart Null-aware Operator Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to Dart's null-aware operator (`??`). The issue arises when using `??` on a nullable variable that might already have a non-null value. The compiler's error message could be more helpful in these cases.

## Bug Description

The code in `bug.dart` demonstrates a scenario where a nullable integer variable (`_myVariable`) is used with the null-aware operator.  If `_myVariable` is null, the `??` operator correctly assigns the default value of 0. However, if `_myVariable` is not null, the compiler unexpectedly throws an error.

## Solution

The solution in `bugSolution.dart` addresses this issue by first checking whether the variable is null before using the null-aware operator. This explicitly handles the case where `_myVariable` is not null.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.dart` in a Dart IDE.
3. Attempt to run the code. You will encounter a compilation error.

## Conclusion

The example highlights the importance of carefully considering the potential null state of nullable variables when using null-aware operators in Dart.
